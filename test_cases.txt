TEST CASES

1.	"Successful Login"
- Verify that a user can log in with valid credentials (standard_user)

I've implemented a successful login using the "Login" fixture.
So that it can then be used in other tests and so that there is no duplication of code.
The fixture is in the conftest.py


2.	"Login with Invalid Password"
- Verify that login fails when using a correct username but an incorrect password


3.	"Login with Invalid Username"
- Verify that login fails when using a non-existent username with a correct password

4.	"Login with Empty Fields"
- Verify that login fails when the username and password fields are left empty

5.	"Add Item to Cart"
- Verify that a user can successfully add an item to the cart

6.	"Remove Item from Cart"
- Verify that a user can remove an item from the cart

7.	"Proceed to Checkout"
- Verify that a user can proceed to the checkout page after adding an item to the cart"

8.	"Logout from the System"
